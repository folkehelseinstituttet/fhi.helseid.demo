The app is a plain `dotnet new angular` app with the HelseId component added.

It demonstrates login, logout and protection of all other routes.

## Setup
Copy the `appsettings.Template.json` and name it `appsettings.json`.
Configure your client using the different settings.

You need to have a client that is registered in HelseId's test environment in order to setup this demo.
